            <ul type="dot">
                <li>Create Application without backend server</li>
                <li>No need extra money spent for backend server</li>
                <li>Sync real time data in the application</li>
                <li>Faster then any backend web services</li>
                <li>Quick display data in the application</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-primary">The other way of authentication:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Password-based authentication</li>
                <li>Multi-factor authentication</li>
                <li>Certificate-based authentication</li>
                <li>Biometric authentication</li>

            <ul type="dot">
                <li>Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting on as many as 500 separate events. Analytics presents data about user behavior in iOS and Android apps, enabling better decision-making about improving performance and app marketing.
                </li>
                <li>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging tool that lets companies reliably receive and deliver messages on iOS, Android and the web at no cost.</li>
                <li>The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that enables data to be stored and synced between users in real time. The data is synced across all clients in real time and is still available when an app goes offline.</li>
                <li>Firebase Crashlytics is a real-time crash reporter that helps developers track, prioritize and fix stability issues that reduce the quality of their apps. With crashlytics, developers spend less time organizing and troubleshooting crashes and more time building features for their apps.</li>
                <li>Firebase Performance Monitoring service gives developers insight into the performance characteristics of their iOS and Android apps to help them determine where and when the performance of their apps can be improved</li>
                <li>Firebase Test Lab is a cloud-based app-testing infrastructure. With one operation, developers can test their iOS or Android apps across a variety of devices and device configurations. They can see the results, including videos, screenshots and logs, in the Firebase console.</li>
